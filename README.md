SublimeLinter-contrib-phpstan
================================

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) provides an interface to [phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

## Installation
SublimeLinter must be installed in order to use this plugin.

Please use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) to install the linter plugin.

By default, this plugin uses PHPStan from `vendor/bin`. Otherwise, it will fall back to a global `phpstan` executable (in that case, you must ensure that its path is available to SublimeLinter, see [troubleshooting PATH configuration](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable)).
